# Realtime Chat App

A really simple idea of an app that using PHP, MySQL and Vanilla JavaScript. The project idea came originally
from [codingnepalweb](www.codingnepalweb.com) specifically this article/video [Chat Web Application using PHP with MySQL & JavaScript](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/chat-web-application-using-php/)
where I have expanded on and added some extra functionality.

The project structure has changed a little but nothing drastic. Below are the steps to getting started.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project ensure you have PHP and MySQL install on your machine. you can easily achieve this
by using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) details on getting up and running can be found on the official website.

Once XAMPP is installed go ahead and set up a new project folder and start the Apache and MySQL. 

Git clone the project using the following command into your project folder:
```git
git clone https://github.com/ShaneMuir/chat-app
```
You will need to import the database. Create a new database and import the chatapp.sql file that you should now have in your project folder.

Update `/php/config.php` with your own config vars.
